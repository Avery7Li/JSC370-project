# Volleyball as a Team Sport

Volleyball is among the most popular team sports around the world. The players and audience enjoy it because of the strength, sportsmanship, and team collaboration demonstrated in the game. However, one may wonder that, to what extent is volleyball a team sport? In other words, which between a player’s capability and team cooperation contributes more to winning a game?

This question further breaks down to the following subquestions to be discussed in this report:
1. How much does the score a player wins in a game depend on her personal capacity, such as physical traits and experience?
2. Is there a particular position or “ace” in the team critical for winning the game?
3. Is there an association between the performances of two team members at specific positions in a game?

In this project, I analyzed data from the FIVB Volleyball Nations League (VNL) to better understand the mechanisms of volleyball.
